This is a brief introduction to a JavaScript-based 2048 game.

The game uses a 4x4 grid layout and allows tiles to slide and merge in four directions: left, right, up, and down. The objective is to reach the 2048 tile.

Upon starting, the game initializes with an empty board and a "Start" button. Clicking the "Start" button generates two tiles with a value of 2 at random positions.

Data tracking includes the player's score and best score. DOM manipulation is utilized to interact with elements, and event listeners respond to button clicks and page load.

Game logic involves tile generation, keyboard input handling, sliding and merging functions, and game over checks. Utility functions handle specific tasks.

To start the project in VS Code, download it to a folder named 'projects'.
