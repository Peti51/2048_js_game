This is a short introduction to a 2048 game implemented in JavaScript.

The game is built using the 4x4 grid layout and contains functionality to slide and merge tiles in four directions: left, right, up, and down. The goal of the game is to reach the tile with a value of 2048.

The game initializes with an empty board and displays a "Start" button. When the "Start" button is clicked, the game begins by generating two tiles with a value of 2 at random positions on the board.

Variables and Data Structures: The game tracks 'score' and 'best' values, has a 4x4 'board' array, and uses 'rows' and 'columns' to define the grid dimensions.

DOM Manipulation: 'document.getElementById()' accesses elements, 'document.createElement()' dynamically creates elements, and 'element.innerText' and 'element.classList' update content and styles.

Event Listeners: The script responds to 'window.onload' and button clicks using event listeners.

Game Logic: The initialization function sets up the game, including hiding elements and resetting scores. 
Tile generation randomly generates tiles with values. Keyboard input handling responds to arrow key presses. Sliding and merging functions control tile movements.
Game over conditions are checked. Tile updates visually represent changes on the board.

Utility Functions: Functions filter zeros in a row and update tile visuals.

In order to be able to start the project from vsCode ypou need to download the project to a folder named 'projects'.
